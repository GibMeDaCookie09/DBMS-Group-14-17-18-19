Problem Statement:-
The organization needs a reliable and well-designed database system to simplify its operations and manage all important workflows efficiently. This system should be able to handle client details easily, their unique client IDs, names, addresses, and phone numbers, ensuring smooth communication and better service. It should also help in managing orders, allowing clients to place orders that are tracked with a unique order ID and date. Additionally, the system must handle payment tracking, keeping a record of payment IDs, amounts, and payment methods for every order to ensure clarity and accuracy in financial transactions.

The database should also focus on managing products effectively. It should store essential details like product IDs and descriptions while keeping track of which employees are working on which products and the dates they worked. For production, the system needs to have a raw materials management feature to track raw material IDs, names, quantities, prices, and supplier details. This will help the organization maintain an uninterrupted supply of materials and avoid delays.

Managing employee details is another crucial aspect of this system. It should store important information such as SSN, names, roles, salaries, and contact numbers. The system should also record who is supervising whom and which products employees are assigned to, making it easier to manage the workforce and increase accountability.

Lastly, the system must simplify payment processing by linking all payments to their respective orders. It should support various payment methods and ensure every financial transaction is recorded accurately. By combining all these features client management, order processing, product and raw material tracking, employee records, and payment tracking the database system will help the organization run smoothly and efficiently. This solution will provide a centralized platform for managing day-to-day activities, improving productivity, and ensuring transparency in all operations.
